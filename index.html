        <h2 id="trib1">Early Life</h2>
        <p>Rida was brought up in a conservative family in Coorg. However, now she lives in Bangalore which is her second home. She studied biotechnology in college. She always knew that if she has to make a mark in the world, she has to work and strive her way up. And that’s when she started her journey as a content creator not just to inspire herself but to all the women around her. Most of her content is all about motivational videos, self reminders, breaking stereotypes, empowering women and we really admire her for that. Here’s one of those videos that made her viral.
        <p>

          One of her most popular videos has been of breaking stereotypes and about women taking charge in a society that’s always against them. Apart from her content and a family of over half a million online, she also hosts workshops on confidence-building and public speaking.

          <h2 id="trib1">Post-secondary education</h2>
          <p>In her school years, Rida had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had
            a
            strong desire to learn. She spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics. <br /><br /></p>

          <h2 id="trib1">Higher Studies</h2>
          <p>After completing her education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Rida went on to
            attend Saint Joseph's
            College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where she graduated. <br /><br /></p>

          <h2 id="trib1">Journey as a Content Creater</h2>
          <p>My journey has been really amazing. It’s been a roller coaster ride with lots of ups and downs but it has given me a lot of exposure and happiness. As I am someone who creates content around issues women face, sometimes, because of my experiences, it comes off a little bit stronger but someone has to put it out there and I do that job.
            <br /><br />
          </p>

          <h2 id="trib1">After Studies</h2>
          <p> However, I love the people who follow me and I love how excited they are for the content that I put out every single day. The way they engage, the number of shares I get on my videos, just make me feel like I am not alone in the world and we can all fight and win together so it feels really nice.<br /><br /></p>

            <p>Rida began her social media journey on Instagram and TikTok by sharing her short pranks, song covers, dance, videos, and gorgeous, lifestyle photos. She gained fame on the platforms, within a short span of time, as her photos and videos garnered millions of followers. But in 2019, due to some security purposes, TikTok was banned by the central gov of India.



              Similarly, Rida has gathered more than 641K followers as of now 2022, on Instagram because of her gorgeous, attractive, and captivating photos and video content.

            I was not really sure if I could make my influencing journey into a career but I have always loved being in front of the camera and loved speaking. I knew this was my niche because I had been modeling and a professional emcee for 6 years so I used to host a lot of shows and gigs. As I started growing on Instagram after Reels was introduced, it gave me the hype, I realized that I can consider this as a career option and use this as a platform to improve the society around me. Now, I am not just known for my face but also my skill set which is out there for everyone to see and it makes it easier for me in the world of modeling and public speaking.
